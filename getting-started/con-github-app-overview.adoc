= GitHub Appâ€‹ overview

GitHub Apps manage OAuth scope at the app installation level, rendering the scope parameter ineffective in the frontend. Nevertheless, it is crucial to include the necessary scope in open source plugins and document the required scopes for GitHub Apps in the plugin README.

NOTE: GitHub Apps are generally preferred to OAuth apps because they use fine-grained permissions, give more control over which repositories the app can access, and use short-lived tokens.
